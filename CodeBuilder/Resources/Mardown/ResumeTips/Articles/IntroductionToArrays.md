# Introduction to Arrays

Arrays are collections of elements that **store data** in a sequential order. They are one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.

## Why Use Arrays?

- **Fast access**: Access elements by their index.
- **Efficient storage**: Store multiple values in a single variable.
- **Sequential organization**: Maintain the order of elements.

## Example in Swift

```swift
// Declare an array of integers
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Access the first element
let first = numbers[0]

// Add a new element
numbers.append(6)
